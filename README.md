# QuantumEntanglement
Disproving EPR through the violation of Bell's Inequality in an experiment conducted on an entangled bipartite system.
The Jupyter Notebook uses IBM's Qiskit and Quantum Labs to conduct an experiment to visualise the violation of Bell's Inequality. The PDF presents a brief mathematical overview of disproving the hidden variable theory and local realism and to confirm Quantum Mechanics.
